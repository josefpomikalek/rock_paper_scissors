# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" children's game using **Python**. This project is designed as an easy way to practice basic programming concepts, such as conditionals and user input, while also having fun!

## About
"Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a well-known hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:
- 🪨 **Rock**: Crushes Scissors
- ✂️ **Scissors**: Cuts Paper
- 📄 **Paper**: Covers Rock

The rules are simple: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the game ends with a draw.

This project is a simple Python command-line version of the game where a player competes against the computer.

## How to Play
